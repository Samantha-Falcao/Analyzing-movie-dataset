### Project Overview

 The aim of this project is exploration of a movie dataset. The tasks included are extraction of movies with high ratings, specific language, and also identify duplicate entries in the dataset. The dataset consists of the movies in more than 50 Languages and we have to extract English movies of a high rating. Using Python skills to solve this problem, the goal is to analyze the data and curate a list of English movies with high-ratings.

This project was completed as a part of Data Science program at GreyAtom EduTech Pvt. Ltd.


### Learnings from the project

 This project helped me to extensively revise and work with fundamental concepts in Python. Gave me a better undertanding of creating resuable blocks of code with the help of user-defined functions, reading files, working with custom lists and dictionaries, indexing and slicing, working with 2D arrays, using nested loops, conditional statements, comprehensions, etc.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 -  Broke down the problem into smaller tasks.

- Created resuable functions for each extraction task.

-  Included detailed docstrings for each custom function

-  Used appropriate indexing and slicing methods to grab relevant data.
